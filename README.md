# Globe-Trotter
An Arduino based Image Viewing System

Globe Trotter is a fun, tangible picture viewer. It allows you to browse through the photos you have taken in a playful way. By touching a country you can select an album, and then, by spinning the globe back and forth, you can browse your album.Individual metal pins are pinned to the countries. A capacitive sensor is then hooked to these pin which is linked to the Arduino. A rotary encoder is attached to the axis of the globe, in order to be able to get the globe's position.The main Arduino program processes the data in the Arduino Micro (UNO not supported), which then sends keyboard signals to the computer. On the computer is acustom webpage that contains all the photos. The user can then browse the photos by interacting with the globe!
